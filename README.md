# Automated Flappy Bird

This project implements an automated version of the popular game Flappy Bird using Python and the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library. The game features a neural network trained through NEAT to play Flappy Bird autonomously, achieving the highest score possible.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pygame
- NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)

# Features:
- Neural network-based gameplay: The game utilizes NEAT to train a neural network to play Flappy Bird automatically.
- Automated gameplay: The neural network controls the bird's movements, allowing it to navigate through pipes and accumulate points.
- Real-time visualization: The game provides a real-time display of the current score, generation, and number of birds alive.
- Modular design: The code is organized into classes for birds, pipes, and the game environment, facilitating easy understanding and modification.

# How to Run:
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Download the project files from the repository.
3. Run the `flappy_bird.py` script to start the game.
4. Watch as the neural network learns to play Flappy Bird autonomously!
